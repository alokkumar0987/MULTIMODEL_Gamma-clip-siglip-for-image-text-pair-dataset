üñº Vision-Language Model from Scratch

This project implements  vision-language model that combines an image encoder with a language model to generate natural language responses from both images and text prompts.


---

üöÄ Workflow

1. Inputs

Image: Example ‚Äì a person resting on a hammock by the beach.

Text Prompt: Example ‚Äì "Where is the photographer resting?"


2. Vision Encoder (SigLIP: 400M)

The image is passed into the SigLIP Contrastive Vision Encoder.

Extracts high-dimensional visual features that represent the scene.


3. Linear Projection

Maps the vision embeddings into the same embedding space as the language model.

Ensures compatibility between image features and text embeddings.


4. Text Tokenization

The text prompt is tokenized using SentencePiece Tokenizer.

Converts the prompt into embeddings.


5. Multimodal Fusion

Projected image embeddings + text token embeddings are concatenated.

Creates a multimodal sequence that contains both image and text information.


6. Language Model (Gemma: 2B Transformer Decoder)

The multimodal sequence is passed into the Gemma language model.

The model attends to both visual features and prompt text to understand context.


7. Output Generation

The model generates a natural language response.

Example Output: ‚ÄúIn a hammock under a tree on a tropical beach.‚Äù
